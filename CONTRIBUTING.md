## Adding your own plugin

Please, sort plugins by name in alphabetical order.

Add a name, a short description and the link the repository to the `README.md`.

Add your own plugin, create a `repo.json` file containing all the metadata
information for your plugin. See the Go plugin
[repo.json](https://github.com/micro-editor/go-plugin/blob/master/repo.json)
file as an example.

Then you can open a pull request which adds the link to that file to the
`channel.json` file in this repo. See the Go plugin as an example.
