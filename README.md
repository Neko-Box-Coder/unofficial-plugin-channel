# üì° Unofficial Micro Plugin Channel

> [!NOTE]
> This channel is a fork of [the discontinued channel](https://github.com/taconi/plugin-channel) by [taconi](https://github.com/taconi). Credit goes to him

## ‚ùìÔ∏è Why an unofficial channel?

See [this](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/issues/2956) and [this](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro/discussions/3285)

Basically, we are having difficulty updating the micro plugin channel and also some of the plugins themselves as we don't have access to merge new changes.

On top of that, I personally would like to do the plugin channel differently. The ability to have a stable and dev channel and easy to understand table for all the plugins.

## üî∞ Getting Started

Edit your `settings.json` located in `~/.config/micro` (Unix) or `C:\Users\<your user name>\.config\micro` (Windows)

There are 2 channels you can choose, stable (recommended) or main. 

- **Stable** 
    - All the plugins in this channel are located in this repo and checked to not contain malicious code.
    - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neko-Box-Coder/unofficial-plugin-channel/stable/channel.json`
- **Main** 
    - All the plugins are located externally with the latest update. 
    - But it is possible to contain malicious code (i.e. supply chain attack).
    - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neko-Box-Coder/unofficial-plugin-channel/main/channel.json`

Choose the ones you want to the `pluginchannels` array in `settings.json`, 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `pluginchannels` is evaluated in order, and by default it is pointed to the official plugin channel. 
> 
> By assigning it to something else, the official plugin channel will not be used anymore.
>
> If you still want to have access to the official one, simple append 
> 
> `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micro-editor/plugin-channel/master/channel.json`

For example,

```json
"pluginchannels": [
    //Get plugins from stable channel first
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neko-Box-Coder/unofficial-plugin-channel/stable/channel.json",
    //The use the official channel last
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micro-editor/plugin-channel/master/channel.json"
]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although plugins in stable channel are checked where they are malicious or not, I **CANNOT** provide any warranty and not responsible in case damage is caused by any of the plugins.
